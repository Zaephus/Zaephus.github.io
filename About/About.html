                    My name is Marc Rozendaal, I'm 22 and I'm a second year Game Development student
                    at HKU in Utrecht. Most of my time is spent building tools and programming
                    systems, which I'm also incredibly interested in.

                    I've always been interested in how everything is made, and even more interested
                    in how games are made. I wondered how giant worlds like those in Skyrim and the 
                    Witcher could be run on anything other than top of the line hardware. I was 
                    intrigued as to how the endless worlds in Minecraft could possibly be generated.

                    Each time I picked up programming and developing over the years, I was always 
                    working on tools and other such things to make life easier down the line. It
                    started out with simple buttons in <a href="https://processing.org">Processing</a>,
                    and later grew into a simple tile based level editor. During these past two years at
                    HKU I have continued to learn about tool and system programming, and am looking to
                    keep learning as much as I can in the coming years.
