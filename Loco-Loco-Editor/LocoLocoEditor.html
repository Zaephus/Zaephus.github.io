                <p>
                    During production of <a href="../Loco-Loco/LocoLoco.html">Loco Loco</a> I built a
                    simple level editor. Having built it in the Unity editor itself, it was lacking in
                    features and ease of use. During a later course at HKU, Production Tools, I decided
                    to extend and improve the editor and make it into a standalone tool. I added camera
                    controls and other shortcuts for ease of use, like pressing 'R' to rotate a tile.
                    I built it with the intention to be able to easily extend the editor by adding more
                    tiles. Having also added saving and loading, this tool allows for quick creation
                    and editing of levels.
