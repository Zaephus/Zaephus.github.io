                <p>
                    For the creation of <a href="../Loco-Loco/LocoLoco.html">Loco Loco</a>, I
                    built a simple level editor, but this tool was lacking in features and ease of
                    use. So at a later date I built this editor, which allows for quick creation and
                    editing of levels. This tool would allow us to speed up production, if we were to
                    continue development of Loco Loco.
