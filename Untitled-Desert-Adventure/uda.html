                    Untitled Desert Adventure is a game where you are a young child from a desert tribe, who gets separated
                    from their family when crossing a river. You eventually wash up on the river bank. From there you follow
                    the river upstream again to get back to your tribe. During your adventure upstream you come across multiple
                    dangerous creatures, which you have to avoid. Later you find a spear, but being a small child, you struggle
                    to wield it successfully. With both the spear and your ability to evade the creatures, you can find your
                    way back to your family.

                    This project took place during Project Vrij II at HKU, where we could choose freely what we wanted to work
                    on during the eight weeks set aside for this project. My roles for this project were team and development
                    lead, where I was responsible for project management, code for the enemy behaviour and integration of all
                    systems into the game.
