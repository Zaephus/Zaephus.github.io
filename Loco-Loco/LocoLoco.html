                        Loco Loco is a game where the player takes on the role of a railway manager who has to make sure the train
                        arrives at its destination safely. To achieve this the player has to work a number of switches to guide
                        the train in the right direction.

                        Loco Loco was made during Project Hybrid at HKU, of which the assignment was to create an experience with
                        both a digital and physical part. For the physical part an arcade box was built to house the game itself
                        and four levers. These levers acted as the controller, with which the player could work the switches in
                        the game.
