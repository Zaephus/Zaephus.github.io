                    Loco Loco is a puzzle game where the player takes on the role of a railway manager. The goal is to safely
                    guide the train from point A to point B by working a number of railway switches. The game consists of a
                    large arcade machine, with a screen in the middle and two levers on either side. The levers have coloured
                    icons on them, which match with the coloured icons next to the switches in the game. Pulling a lever switches
                    every railway switch with the corresponding icon.

                    Loco Loco was a group project at HKU, for which we had about four weeks. The assignment was to create an
                    experience with both a digital and physical part. During this project I was in charge of gameplay programming,
                    where I spent most of my time working on the movement for the train and the functionality of the switches. I
                    also built a basic Level Editor, with which my teammates could quickly build and iterate on levels. At a later
                    date I improved and extended the editor into <a href="../Loco-Loco-Editor/LocoLocoEditor.html">Loco Loco Editor</a>.
