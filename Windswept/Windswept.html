                        This project took place during Project Context II, where we got an assignment from
                        an external client. In this case that client was TNO, who asked us to create a game
                        about the communication between energy companies and the community about placing
                        windmills and solar farms in their community. The goal of this game was to show
                        the higher-ups of these energy companies the importance of an open conversation
                        between the company and the community.

                        This was a difficult project, since we couldn't agree on an approach with the client.
                        So after a number of iterations we settled on a game where you are the one responsible
                        for placing the windmills, but you don't know whether the community will be okay with
                        your placement until you talk to them.

                        During this project I was the sole developer. I spent most of my time working on all
                        the gameplay systems making the game work. One of the things I built was a level
                        editor, which tied into almost all systems within the game. The level editor allowed
                        our game designer to not only design the level, but also place the people on the
                        level, and design the approval rates for every tile. With the game taking place on an
                        hexagonal grid, I had to use a different coordinate system. This challenged my math
                        and programming skills.
