                        During a course at HKU, called Graphics Programming, we learned the basics of rendering
                        with OpenGL. <br> I decided to work with <a href="https://opentk.net/">OpenTK</a>, which is a set of C#
                        bindings for OpenGL. During the course I spent my time working on creating a full fledged
                        and easy to use rendering engine, with some basics of a game engine.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description left-item">
                        I added most basic rendering features to this engine, like lighting, texturing and lit and unlit
                        materials. I built a pipeline to make it as easy as I could make it to create and setup a scene with
                        models, materials and a camera. I added model loading by using the
                        <a href="https://github.com/assimp/assimp-net">Assimp-Net</a> library, which makes it easy to load in
                        both models and materials from 3D model files. I also spent some time working on optimizing the rendering
                        by decreasing the amount of draw calls made on meshes and materials. Doing this I was able to draw 10x to
                        50x more objects than I was able to before.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description left-item">
                        I built my own component and game object system, allowing for the quick creating of modular game objects.
                        One of these components is a Transform component, containing the position and directions of the game object.
                        A Transform also contains the world matrix for the game object, which is used in all transformations of the
                        game object and is used by the shaders to display the objects correctly.

                    <p class="description left-item">
                        A lot of my time was spent building my own math library, including all vectors, quaternions and matrix classes.
                        I decided to work on this since I was interested in this type of math and wanted to get a deeper understanding
                        into this type of math. These classes required multiple edits and additions during the course of creating this
                        engine, forcing me to dive deeper and deeper into the math of these classes.

                        Since C++ is a more powerful and widely used language than C# is in graphics programming, I have recently
                        started rewriting this engine in C++ and Vulkan. I chose Vulkan since it is a newer graphics API than OpenGL,
                        as a way to challenge myself and be able to dive deeper into the world of graphics programming. I started out
                        by following the tutorial on <a href="https://vulkan-tutorial.com/">vulkan-tutorial.com</a>, and I am currently
                        refactoring and abstracting the code I wrote following that tutorial. The plan is to implement all the features
                        from the C# engine. Afterwards I want to add a UI and expand the feature set of the engine, with a focus on
                        usability and expandability.
